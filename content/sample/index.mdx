## Getting started

Canopy IIIF is an open-source static site generator designed for IIIF collections. This template is ready for your collection, context, and publishing.

### Point to your collection

- Open `canopy.yml` and set `collection` to the IIIF Collection you want to feature.
- Review `metadata` and `featured` entries—adjust them to suit the facets and works you want to highlight.

### Tune layouts and pages

- Customize `content/index.mdx`, `content/about/`, and add new folders under `content/` for exhibits or guides.
- Modify `content/works/_layout.mdx` to control how individual manifests render.
- Update `content/_app.mdx` to adjust site-wide structure.
- Browse the component catalog and usage patterns in the docs to extend the narrative beyond default manifests.
